= Remo Fritzsche's TextMate Bundle

A very simple TextMate bundle which contains some snippets and things (comment blocks, timestamps) for
the programmers every-days needs.

== Installation

  cd ~/Library/"Application Support"/TextMate/Bundles/

If that directory wasn't found, you'll need to create it, then:

  git clone git://github.com/remofritzsche/remofritzsche_textmate.git "remofritzsche.tmbundle"
